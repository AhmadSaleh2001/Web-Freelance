# Car Driving School Project

Welcome to the Car Driving School project! This project is a website designed to assist users in preparing for their Driving Theory test. The website provides a collection of exams for the Driving Theory test, allowing users to practice and test their knowledge. After submitting their answers, users can view their incorrect answers and see their final result.

## My Role

In this project, my role was as follows:

1. **Designing the Database and Building the Backend**: I was responsible for designing the database structure and implementing the backend functionality of the website. This included handling user authentication, allowing admins to manage questions and exam categories, and providing additional functionalities such as the ability to copy exams from one category to another. For example, it was possible to copy an exam from the "Car Theory Test" category to the "Bus Theory Test" category. I also implemented features to manipulate each exam, including its questions and corresponding answers.

2. **Integrating the Static Frontend with the Backend**: I integrated the static frontend templates with the backend functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience. This involved connecting the frontend elements, such as buttons and forms, to the appropriate backend endpoints and handling the data flow between the frontend and backend components.

3. **Data Scraping**: I used Python to scrape data from a specific website. This involved extracting 4,000 questions, each with 4 answer choices, resulting in a total of 24000 pieces of information. The scraped data was then stored in the project's database for later use in the exams.
